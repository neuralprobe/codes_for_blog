      "> People who love all fields of knowledge are the ones who can best spot the patterns that exist across nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Another characteristic of truly innovative and creative people is that they have a reality-distortion field, a phrase that was used about Steve Jobs and comes from a Star Trek episode in which aliens create an entire new world through sheer mental force. When his colleagues protested that one of Jobs’s ideas or proposals would be impossible to implement, he would use a trick he\n",

      "> learned from a guru in India: he would stare at them without blinking and say, “Don’t be afraid. You can do it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> Related to that is the ability to “think different,” as Jobs put it in a memorable set of Apple ads.\n",

      "> One final trait shared by all my subjects is that they retained a childlike sense of wonder.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Jeff Bezos embodies these traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "> That trifecta—humanities, technology, business—is what has made him one of our era’s most successful and influential innovators.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Jeff was a voracious reader with an adventurous mind.\n",
      "\n",
      "> He went to Princeton with the goal of studying physics. It sounded like a smart plan until he\n",

      "> smashed into a course on quantum mechanics.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “That was the very moment when I realized I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist,” Bezos says. “I saw the writing on the wall, and I changed my major very quickly to electrical engineering and computer science.” It was a\n",
      "\n",
      "> difficult realization. His heart had been set on becoming a physicist, but finally he had confronted his own limits.\n",

      "> While working at the hedge fund in 1994, Bezos came across the statistic that the web had been growing by more than 2,300 percent each year.\n",
      "\n",
      "> To make the decision, Bezos used a mental exercise that would become a famous part of his risk-calculation process. He called it a “regret minimization framework.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> As MacKenzie drove, Jeff typed up a business plan and spreadsheets filled with revenue predictions. “You know the business plan won’t survive its first encounters with reality,” he says. “But the discipline of writing the plan forces you to think through some of the issues and to get sort of mentally comfortable in the space. Then you start to understand, if you push on this knob, this will move over here and so on. So, that’s the first step.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> The genesis of Amazon Echo was, in one way, like Steve Jobs’s development of Apple iPod. It arose out of intuition rather than focus groups, and it was not in response to some obvious customer demand. “No customer was asking for Echo,” Bezos says.\n",

      "> “The only reason I’m interested in space is because [NASA] inspired me when I was five years old.\n",

      "> 1. Focus on the long term. “It’s All About the Long Term,” he said in the italicized initial headline in his first shareholder letter in 1997.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Bezos advised his team, “Be the tortoise and not the hare.” Blue Origin’s company shield has a Latin motto, Gradatim Ferociter: “Step by Step, Ferociously.”\n",
      "\n",
      "> 2. Focus relentlessly and passionately on the customer.\n",
      "\n",
      "> 3. Avoid PowerPoint and slide presentations. This is a maxim that Steve Jobs also followed. Bezos’s belief in the power of storytelling means that he thinks that his colleagues should be able to create a readable narrative when they pitch an idea. “We don’t do PowerPoint (or any other slide-oriented) presentations at Amazon,”\n",
      "\n",
      "> 4. Focus on the big decisions. “As a senior executive, what do you really get paid to do?” he asks. “You get paid to make a small number of high-quality decisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "> 5. Hire the right people. “We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees,”\n",

      "> All content in Part 1 and Part 2 of this book is drawn from the words and ideas of Jeff Bezos. Part 1, “The Shareholder Letters,” is composed of the letter sent by Jeff Bezos in April of each year to Amazon.com shareholders. Part 2, “Life and Work,” has been drawn from the following transcripts of interviews and speeches by Jeff Bezos:\n",

      "> “You make money when you sell things—why would you allow negative reviews on your website?” Speaking as a focus group of one, I know I’ve sometimes changed my mind before making purchases on Amazon.com as a result of negative or lukewarm customer reviews. Though negative reviews cost us some sales in the short term, helping customers make better purchase decisions ultimately pays off for the company.\n",

      "> NOVEMBER 19, 2007, was a special day. After three years of work, we introduced Amazon Kindle to our customers.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Kindle is purpose-built for long-form reading. We hope Kindle and its successors may gradually and incrementally move us over years into a world with longer spans of attention, providing a counterbalance to the recent proliferation of info-snacking tools. I realize my tone here tends toward the missionary, and I can assure you it’s heartfelt. It’s also not unique to me but is shared by a large group of folks here. I’m glad about that because missionaries build better products. I’ll also point out that, while I’m convinced books are on the verge of being improved upon, Amazon has no sinecure as ...more\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Working backward” from customer needs can be contrasted with a “skills-forward” approach where existing skills and competencies are used to drive business opportunities. The skills-forward approach says, “We are really good at X. What else can we do with X?” That’s a useful and rewarding business approach. However, if used exclusively, the company employing it will never be driven to develop fresh skills. Eventually the existing skills will become outmoded. Working backward from customer needs often demands that we acquire new competencies and exercise new muscles, never mind how ...more\n",

      "> We have strong conviction that that approach—in the long term—is every bit as good for owners as it is for customers. It’s still Day 1.\n",

      "> RANDOM FORESTS, NAIVE Bayesian estimators, RESTful services, gossip protocols, eventual consistency, data sharding, antientropy, Byzantine quorum, erasure coding, vector clocks: walk into certain Amazon meetings, and you may momentarily think you’ve stumbled into a computer science lecture.\n",
      "\n",
      "> “Because of Kindle Direct Publishing, I earn more royalties in one month than I ever did in a year of writing for a traditional house. I have gone from worrying about if I will be able to pay the bills—and there were many months when I couldn’t—to finally having real savings, even thinking about a vacation; something I haven’t done in years.… Amazon has allowed me to really spread my wings.\n",

      "> “Amazon has made it possible for authors like me to get their work in front of readers and has changed my life.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Invention comes in many forms and at many scales. The most radical and transformative of inventions are often those that empower others to unleash their creativity—to pursue their dreams. That’s a big part of what’s going on with Amazon Web Services, Fulfillment by Amazon, and Kindle Direct Publishing. With AWS, FBA, and KDP, we are creating powerful self-service platforms that allow thousands of people to boldly experiment and accomplish things that would otherwise be impossible or impractical. These innovative, large-scale platforms are not zero-sum—they create win-win situations and create ...more\n",
      "\n",
      "> Amazonians are leaning into the future, with radical and transformational innovations that create value for thousands of authors, entrepreneurs, and developers. Invention has become second nature at Amazon, and in my view the team’s pace of innovation is even accelerating—I can assure you it’s very energizing. I’m extremely proud of the whole team and feel lucky to have a front row seat. It’s still Day 1!\n",
      "\n",
      "> As I write this, our recent stock performance has been positive, but we constantly remind ourselves of an important point—as I frequently quote famed investor Benjamin Graham in our employee all-hands meetings—“In the short run, the market is a voting machine but in the long run, it is a weighing machine.” We don’t celebrate a 10 percent increase in the stock price like we celebrate excellent customer experience. We aren’t 10 percent smarter when that happens and conversely aren’t 10 percent dumber when the stock goes the other way. We want to be weighed, and we’re always working to build a ...more\n",
      "\n",
      "> The outside world can push you into Day 2 if you won’t or can’t embrace powerful trends quickly. If you fight them, you’re probably fighting the future. Embrace them and you have a tailwind. These big trends are not that hard to spot (they get talked and written about a lot), but they can be strangely hard for large organizations to embrace. We’re in the middle of an obvious one right now: machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "> Day 2 companies make high-quality decisions, but they make high-quality decisions slowly.\n",
      "\n",
      "> First, never use a one-size-fits-all decision-making process. Many decisions are reversible, two-way doors. Those decisions can use a light-weight process. For those, so what if you’re wrong? I wrote about this in more detail in last year’s letter. Second, most decisions should probably be made with somewhere around 70 percent of the information you wish you had. If you wait for 90 percent, in most cases, you’re probably being slow. Plus, either way, you need to be good at quickly recognizing and correcting bad decisions. If you’re good at course correcting, being wrong may be less costly than ...more\n",
      "\n",
      "> Fourth, recognize true misalignment issues early and escalate them immediately. Sometimes teams have different objectives and fundamentally different views. They are not aligned. No amount of discussion, no number of meetings will resolve that deep misalignment. Without escalation, the default dispute resolution mechanism for this scenario is exhaustion. Whoever has more stamina carries the decision.\n",
      "\n",
      "> SOMETHING STRANGE AND remarkable has happened over the last twenty years. Take a look at these numbers: 1999 3 percent 2000 3 percent 2001 6 percent 2002 17 percent 2003 22 percent 2004 25 percent 2005 28 percent 2006 28 percent 2007 29 percent 2008 30 percent 2009 31 percent 2010 34 percent 2011 38 percent 2012 42 percent 2013 46 percent 2014 49 percent 2015 51 percent 2016 54 percent 2017 56 percent 2018 58 percent The percentages represent the share of physical gross merchandise sales sold on Amazon by independent third-party sellers—mostly small and medium-sized businesses—as opposed to Amazon retail’s own first party sales. Third-party sales have grown from 3 percent of the total to 58 percent. To put it bluntly: Third-party sellers are kicking our first-party butt. Badly. (less)\n",
      "\n",
      "> We helped independent sellers compete against our first-party business by investing in and offering them the very best selling tools we could imagine and build. There are many such tools, including tools that help sellers manage inventory, process payments, track shipments, create reports, and sell across borders—and we’re inventing more every year. But of great importance are Fulfillment by Amazon and the Prime membership program. In combination, these two programs meaningfully improved the customer experience of buying from independent sellers. With the success of these two programs now so well established, it’s difficult for most people to fully appreciate today just how radical those two offerings were at the time we launched them. We invested in both of these programs at significant financial risk and after much internal debate. We had to continue investing significantly over time as we experimented with different ideas and iterations. We could not foresee with certainty what those programs would eventually look like, let alone whether they would succeed, but they were pushed forward with intuition and heart, and nourished with optimism.

      "> We show him this problem, and he looks at it. He stares at it for a while and says, “Cosign.” I’m, like, “What do you mean,” and Yosanta says, “That’s the answer.” And I’m, like, “That’s the answer?” “Yeah, let me show you.” He sits us down. He writes out three pages of detailed algebra. Everything crosses out, and the answer is cosign, and I say, “Listen, Yosanta, did you just do that in your head?” And he says, “No, that would be impossible. Three years ago I solved a very similar problem, and I was able to map this problem onto that problem, and then it was immediately obvious that the answer was cosign.” That was an important moment for me because it was the very moment when I realized I was never going to be a great theoretical physicist, and so I started doing some soul-searching. In most occupations, if you’re in the ninetieth percentile or above, you’re going to contribute. In theoretical physics, you’ve got to be, like, one of the top fifty people in the world, or you’re really just not helping out much. It was very clear. I saw the writing on the wall and changed my major very quickly to electrical engineering and computer science. (less)\n",
